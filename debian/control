Description: HeeksCAD is a free, open source, CAD application written by Dan Heeks.
 Functionality: Import solid models from STEP and IGES files.
 Draw construction geomtery and lines and arcs.
 Create new primitive solids, or make solids by extruding a sketch or by making a lofted solid between sketches.
 Modify solids using blending, or boolean operations.
 Save IGES, STEP and STL. Printer plot the 2D geometry.
 Import and export dxf files; only lines and arcs at the moment
 .
 The solid modelling is provided by Open CASCADE. http://www.opencascade.org The graphical user interface is made using wxWidgets. http://www.wxwidgets.org
