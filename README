HeeksCAD is not finished, yet.

HeeksCAD is a free, open source, CAD application written by me, Dan Heeks, danheeks@gmail.com

Functionality: Import solid models from STEP and IGES files. Draw construction geometry and lines and arcs. Create new primitive solids, or make solids by extruding a sketch or by making a lofted solid between sketches. Modify solids using blending, or boolean operations. Save IGES, STEP and STL. Printer plot the 2D geometry or to HPGL. Import and export dxf files; lines, arcs, ellipses, splines and polylines are supported. Use the geometric constraints solver to create accurate drawings from rough sketches.



The solid modeling is provided by Open CASCADE. The graphical user interface is made using wxWidgets.

HeeksCAD can be translated into any language. There are currently English, German, and Italian translations.

HeeksCAD has been built for Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, and OpenSUSE.

see the Wiki tab for details

There are packages for Ubuntu.

It is possible to make Add-In modules, see HeeksCNC, HeeksArt?, and HeeksPython? projects.
