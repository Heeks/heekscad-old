# About HeeksCAD
HeeksCAD is a free and open source cross-platform 3D CAD application created by Dan Heeks. The solid modeling is provided by Open CASCADE; the graphical user interface is made using wxWidgets.

# Features
* Import solid models or drawings from STEP, IGES, DXF...
* Save to IGES, STEP, STL, HPGL or even G-Code with the HeeksCNC plugin (see [HeeksCNC repository] (https://github.com/Heeks/heekscad) for more information)
* Draw construction geometry (lines and arcs).
* Create new primitive solids or make solids by extruding a sketch or by making a lofted solid between sketches.
* Modify solids using blending, or boolean operations.
* Use the geometric constraints solver to create accurate drawings from rough sketches.

# Installing
